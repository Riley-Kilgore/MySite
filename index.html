        <h3>About Me</h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Riley Kilgore, currently a student of Computer Science at Bellevue College. I intend to attain my Bachelor's while at Bellevue College before continuing to a graduate
        degree from another school. I also am looking forward to attaining an undergraduate degree in mathematics, mathematics interests me greatly.
        Some of the things I like to do in my free time include spending time with my girlfriend and furthering my non-formal education, this includes but is not limited to reading texts on
        Computer Science and Mathematics. I also enjoy looking into the health benefits of different diets and trying to figure out what dietary habits allow me to perform at peak.

        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, I am working on this site, book exercises, as well as continuing to learn information that will help me complete my Scheme interpreter/compiler project.
        I am also taking a class on statistical modeling in which we are learning to model statistical situations in the language 'R', I intend to recreate the concepts that we are learning about in
        class using a combinations of R, Python, and Julia. I will only be using select assignments in these situations, but I intend to find problems outside of class that contain the same concepts
        as spoken about in class.
